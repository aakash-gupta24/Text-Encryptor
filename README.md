Text Encryptor is a software that is developed using pure python. The text Encryptor takes a text and encrypts it locally on the device using a self developed algorithm. The algorithm the software works on is based on randomisation where the same text when encrypted gives different results every time making it hard to crack. The software has a password feature where you can add a password to the encryption which will be required to decrypt the text. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome.
